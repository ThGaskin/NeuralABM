  description: A (dummy) model illustrating the utopya interface
  long_description: >
    This model does not really do anything: It simply sums up a bunch of random
    numbers in a state container, writing out all values and the corresponding
    mean value.
    It mainly serves to illustrate the interface that is needed in order to run
    a model using utopya.
