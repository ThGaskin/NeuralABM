# Datasets for the Harris-Wilson model of economic activity

This folder contains several datasets, both real and synthetic, that can be used to train the neural net and learn 
parameters for the Harris-Wilson equations. Simply set the `load_from_dir` key in the `run_cfg.yml` file to point
to the folder containing the data: the data will automatically be loaded and 
the model trained on that data. When plotting, take care to adjust any `true_parameters` keys if you want 
to compare the model predictions to the ground truths.

## Synthetic data 
The `synthetic_data` folder contains synthetically generated networks, origin sizes, and destination sizes. The name of the 
folder indicates the network size, i.e. `N_100_M_10` means N=100 and M=10. 
The specific configurations for each dataset are given by the `config.yml` files in the folders. 
There are noiseless and noisy datasets.

## London data 
The `London_data` folder contains datasets of economic activity across Greater London. The `GLA_data` folder 
contains the data compiled from the two GLA studies on ward profiles and 
retail floor space. The `dest_sizes.csv` and `origin_sizes.csv` are the destination and 
origin zone sizes used in the paper. The `exp_times.csv` and `exp_distances.csv` 
are the two different transport network metrics used, calculated via 
`exp(-d_{ij}/max(d_{ij}))` from the respective `distances.csv` and `times.csv` files. The `Google_Distance_Matrix_Data` folder contains transport times and distances using 
the Google Maps API service. Each file is a pkl-dictionary containing the API output for different 
travel modes: `transit` (public transport) and `driving` (driving, no traffic).
The `departure_time` for transit is Sunday, June 19th 2022, 1 pm GMT (in Unix time: `departure_time = 1655640000`). However, since
trips in the past cannot be computed, a future date must always be specified when using the 
API. The data is also available as a cost matrix in `.csv` format: entries are given in seconds and metres
respectively.

Also available are Euclidean distances, and the densities from running the MCMC analysis at
[this repository](https://github.com/lellam/cities_and_regions).
